# Combinational Logic Components

In this section, we will further our exploration of the SystemVerilog language by building some common combinational logic circuits.

This practical session is designed to be standalone. However, chapter 4 in [1] will compliment it as supplementary reading.

## Intended Learning Outcomes

By the end of this section, you should be able to:

* Create and test a generic N-to-1 multiplex using different styles of SystemVerilog
* Create and test components with tri-state outputs
* Use don't care inputs to simplify a HDL design
* Perform arithmetic operations in SystemVerilog
* Create and test generic encoders and decoder objects in SystemVerilog
* Evaluate the gate cost of synthesising combinational logic devices for an FPGA
* Write and test SystemVerilog tasks and functions to reduce repetition in HDL
