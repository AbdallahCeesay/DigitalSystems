# Finite State Machines
One of the most important design patterns in digital electronics is the Finite State Machine (FSM). The ability to follow a sequence of steps, often in response to input stimulus, is somewhat similar to execution of an instruction in a microprocessor. The similarity is not accidental either.

There are generally speaking two types of FSM:

* Moore Machine
* Mealy Machine

Both can be made to perform the same task, and both will be studied.
