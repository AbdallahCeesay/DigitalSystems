# Sequential Logic

In this section, we will begin to look at sequential logic circuits.

This practical session is designed to be standalone. However, chapter 5 in [1] will compliment it as supplementary reading.

## Intended Learning Outcomes

By the end of this section, you should be able to:

* Cascade Flips Flops to build shift registers
* Compare, contrast and explain the terms set-up-time and hold-time
* Demonstrate the role of propagation delay in shift registers
* Design and test a multi-bit registers to store values
* Design and test sequential counters
* Read and write to memory storage
* Employ test strategies for sequential logic

## Sequential Logic Components
This sections makes use of the components developed in the [previous section](seq_logic.md) to build further reusable sequential components. It is very important to have a good understanding of latches and flip-flops before attempting this section.

There are many sequential logic devices we could build, but we will focus on a small subset. The practise and techniques learned will hopefully put you in a good position to develop your own.

A very important aspect of this is understanding the intrinsic (and sometimes engineered) timing properties of sequential logic, in particular flip-flops. We will therefore discuss propagation delay, setup-time and hold-time.

In future section, you will find that the components discussed in this section and the previous will be reused multiple times.
